MAGIC Gamma Telescope Classification

This project uses the Magic Gamma Telescope dataset to classify high-energy particle events as gamma or hadron based on their physical characteristics.

This projects uses multiple models for classification like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes (GaussianNB), Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, SVM, etc. The project also shows us the difference in their accuracies and helps us understand how to determine which model should be used for the dataset.
